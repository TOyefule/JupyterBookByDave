<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">What is JavaScript?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.. JavaScript is the pr</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">ogramming language of the browser. It allows you to make web pages interactive by manipulating the HTML Document (called the DOM) that is loaded in the browser. Each web browser implements its own </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">JavaScript engine so JavaScript code runs on the client, not the server. This r</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">elieves server of processing effort for simple tasks like validating data and gives the user a more interactive web experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">What is the DOM?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">The DOM (Document Object Model) is the collection of objects that make up a web page. These objects are structured as a collection of nodes - each connected to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">What is event-driven Programming?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Event-driven programming is a <span>programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">When</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"> does JavaScript execute?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">JavaScript code will execute in response to an event being fired. So if a user clicks a button or a web page finishes loading an event will be fired. In the first case, the button_click event and the on_load event. These events are set (or registered) as event handlers on the nodes of the DOM.</span></p>
