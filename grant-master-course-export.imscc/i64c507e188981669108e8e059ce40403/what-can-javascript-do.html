<h3><span>What can JavaScript do?</span></h3>
<p><span>JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it. The browser contains a JavaScript engine that processes the JavaScript so the server does not have to.</span></p>

<p>The document object model (DOM) is a collection of nodes in the web browser's memory that represent the current web page. The nodes are organized as a hirearchy. When the DOM is changed the web browser immediately displays the results of the change.</p>
