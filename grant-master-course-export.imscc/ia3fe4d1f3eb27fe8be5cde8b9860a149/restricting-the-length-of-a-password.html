<title>Assignment: Restricting the Length of a Password</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Make sure you include the link for jQuery in your page in order for the $() function to work properly. If you don't include jQuery then you can replace $('#password') with<span> </span><span>document.getElementById("password");</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>Assume you have a form with a text field. The field has the ID of password. To make sure the password has the proper number of characters, you could use a conditional statement to test the password’s length like this:</p>
<pre>  var password = $('#password').val();
  if (password.length 15) {
     alert('That password is too long.');
}
</pre>
<p>The code in this example uses jQuery to get the value of the password field— $('#password').val()—but the rest of the code is plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>A great way to use this validation snippet would be to put it into its own function like this:</p>
<pre>function verifyPassword() {
var password = $('#password').val();
if (password.length 15)
{
alert('That password is too long.');
}
}
</pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Add this script to a page to ensure their password is the right length.</p>
