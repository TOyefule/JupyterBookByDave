<title>Assignment: Repeating Code with JavaScript Loops</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You can make your program more efficient and write less code if you use loops to repeat blocks of code. You can even include conditionals inside the loop to determine when to exit the loop. Loops allow your program to perform the same task over and over again enabling it to rapidly complete repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>Loops always need an exit condition. Many loops implement some sort of counter while others require a variable or condition to be checked each time through the loop to decide if the loop should continue running or exit.</p>
<h3>Your Assignment:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write a JavaScript for loop that prints the numbers 1 to 50</li>
<li>Write a JavaScript while loop that prints the numbers 1 to 50</li>
<li>Modify the for loop to only print even numbers. Hint: Use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder_()">remainder operator</a>, %.</li>
</ol>
