<title>Assignment: Guessing Game</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Implement the following program in JavaScript:</h3>
<p>I'm thinking of a number. Guess it. If you've ever played that game or some version of it you're ready for the next assignment. The computer will "pick" a number. Actually, you'll program one in the code. You can use a random number if you're ambitious.</p>
<p>Create a number-guessing game using a while-loop. The loop will allow users to guess until they get the number right. Your program will keep looping as long as the guess is different from the secret number.</p>
<p>The output should look like this: (Secret number = 6)</p>
<pre>I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Try to guess it.<br>Your guess: 5<br>That is incorrect. Guess again.<br>Your guess: 8<br>That is incorrect. Guess again.<br>Your guess: 6<br>That's right! You're a good guesser.</pre>
